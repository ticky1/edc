	<h1>Welcome to Other</h1>
	<p>Welcome to those who have stumbled upon my other page. I will continue with random mumble things that probably don't matter to you or may cause a slight disturbance in your force. If you prefer to not read anything more that I have to write. Please move the curse to your uppper right hand corner and hit exit, close out the window and continue on with your life. Also if you want to keep reading. Please now that I am hungry and would like it if I got tacos. I know I just had lunch but that wasn't enough for my stomach. I will go on a hunt for the food i desire. Infact please click on my picture and return to the home page and restart from the beining. If you are bored I have provided a button for your amusement.</p>
